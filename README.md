# JHipster Consul Registry

This project is an alternative registry implementation to [JHipster Registry](https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster-registry), using Consul for service discovery and cloud configuration.

It features hot-reload as well as filesystem and git support.

## Filesystem mode

In this mode, the **consul-config-loader** agent pushes all YAML properties files in the `config/` directory to consul K/V store. It automatically detects when files are added or edited to reload them into Consul.

To use this mode, configure those properties in `bootstrap.yml`:
```
spring:
    cloud:
        consul:
            config:
                format: yaml
                profile-separator: "-"
```
Then run `docker-compose -f quickstart/consul-loader-filesystem.yml up` to start a Consul server on localhost and and its
 agent.
You can then access [http://localhost:8500/ui/#/dc1/kv/config/](http://localhost:8500/ui/#/dc1/kv/config/) and watch as your Consul K/V store is synchronised with property files in the `config/` directory.

# Git mode

To use this mode, configure those properties in `bootstrap.yml`:
```
spring:
    cloud:
        consul:
            config:
                fail-fast: true
                format: files
                profile-separator: "-"
```
This mode is recommended for production, it is a wrapper around [git2consul](https://github.com/Cimpress-MCP/git2consul) project.
You will have to configure the `config/git2consul.json` file to have it load its configuration from your own git repository.

Simply run `docker-compose up` to start Consul and the agent.
